# rewind-dart

This is a command-line tool for retrieving cached web pages, written in Dart. It's partially based on [CacheView](https://github.com/corbindavenport/cacheview). Google Cache, Bing Cache, and the Wayback Machine are supported.

I made this as an experiment in learning Dart, so the codebase is probably terrible.
